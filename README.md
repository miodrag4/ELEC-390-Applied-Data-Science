# ELEC-390-Design-and-Development-with-Applied-Data-Science
ELEC 390 is a course aimed at preparing students for the definition, design, and development of engineering projects and products. It covers topics such as design principles, management techniques, development methodologies, and intellectual property. The course includes the introduction and use of software and tools for design and development.

# This repository includes the following:

# Lab 1 :
- Introduction to Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, and Git.

# Lab 2 : 
- Web Scraping with Python.

# Lab 3 :
- Performing queries on the well-known ‘employees’ database.

# Lab 4 :
- This lab includes 2 main components. First, our goal is to visualize a widely used ‘Heart Disease
 Dataset’ to get some high-level information about the distribution of the data. Next, we aim to
 apply PCA and t-SNE on another widely used dataset called the ‘wine quality dataset’, with the
 foal of performing dimensionality reduction.

# Project :  
- Goal
The goal of the project is to build a desktop app that can distinguish between ‘walking’ and
‘jumping’ with a reasonable accuracy, using the data collected from the accelerometers of a
smartphone.

- Description
The project involves building a small and simple desktop application that accepts accelerometer
data (x, y, and z axes) in CSV format, and writes the outputs into a separate CSV file. The output
CSV file contains the labels (‘walking’ or ‘jumping’) for the corresponding input data. For
classification purposes, the system will use a simple classifier, i.e., logistic regression.
In order to accomplish the goal of the final project and complete the report, the following 7 steps
are required:
1. Data collection
2. Data storing
3. Visualization
4. Pre-processing
5. Feature extraction
6. Training the model
7. Creating a simple desktop application with a simple UI that shows the output
